# AMLSII_assignment ELEC0135 20/21 

 The task of this assignment is to complete track 1 and track 2 of the New Trends in Image Restoration and Enhancement (NTIRE) challenge on example-based single image super-resolution. The model used is a modified version of ESRGAN. ESRGAN enhances the SRGAN  model with the Residual-in-Residual Dense Block (RRDB) without batch normalization and the idea of relativistic GAN  to reconstruct more realistic and natural super-resolution images. However, the perceptual loss is heavily made up of the losses computed from the neural networks, feature loss, and discriminator loss, which are features in the black-box, and whether these features can effetely capture the high-frequency details of the images is still a question. In this assignment,the ESRGAN edge-assisted model (ESRGAN-EA) is proposed, where the soft edge loss is used as a component of the generator loss, which can explicitly direct the model to learn edge information from the images. The results show that the reconstructed SR images generated by the edge-assisted model have fewer artifacts compared to ESRGAN, especially in track 2.

# Acknowledge

Code used in this assignment is modified in the base of [Github: peteryuX/esrgan-tf2](https://github.com/peteryuX/esrgan-tf2) and follow the MIT license.

# Installation

Create a new python virtual environment by [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)  and use the pip tool to install dependent  libraries.

## Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/WeichenLi2020/AMLSII_assignment20_21.git
```

## Create virtual environment

```
conda create -n esrgan-ea python=3.6
conda activate esrgan-ea
```

## Install dependent libraries

```
conda install --yes --file requirements.txt
```

# Dataset download

Download [DIV2K dataset](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/) Track 1 and track 2 training dataset and validation dataset. Put the "DIV2K" folder into the "data" folder in this repository.

# Run the code

The function of file `main.py`  is to train both ESRGAN and ESRGAN-EA models for tasks in track 1 and track 2. The test results will automatically save in the folder "results".

```
python main.py # train and test models
```

# Weight reuse

If you want to accelerate the training progress by reuse the pre-trained model in [Github: peteryuX/esrgan-tf2](peteryuX/esrgan-tf2), download the pre-trained model in [ESRGAN](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Nnob9TIAL1f6ef2C_YnS97KxM91bmE0_/view?usp=sharing) and unzip the file into folder "./track1_bicubic/checkpoints" or "./track2_unknown/checkpoints" before training.
